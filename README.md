## General Info

- <b> Objective: </b> Development of the capstone projects of the course [Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp) by [Jose Portilla](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jmportilla). 

## Project 1 - 911 Calls Data Analysis
- <b> Objective: </b>Exploratory Data Analysis on a Dataset of emergency 911 calls from 2015 to 2022 at Montgomery County, PA. This dataset can be viewed on this [link from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mchirico/montcoalert).

## Project 2 - Stock Prices Data Analysis
- <b> Objective: </b>Exploratory Data Analysis on a dataset of stock prices from different banks from the World. The dataset for each bank was downloaded through [Pandas Datareader](https://pandas-datareader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/remote_data.html).

## Project 3 - Linear Regression on an E-commerce Dataset
- <b> Objective: </b>Given a dataset of costumer behavior on an e-commerce application, train a Linear Regression model to determine how the company should focus future investments.

## Project 4 - Logistic Regression on an Advertising Dataset
- <b> Objective: </b>Given a dataset of Advertisement Data (including costumer features and whether they clicked on one particular ad), train a Logistic Regression model to predict if future costumers are likely to click on an ad.

## Project 5 - KNN Classifier on an Anonymous Dataset
- <b> Objective: </b>Given a dataset of Anonymous Data, train a K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier model to predict the Target Class.

## Project 6 - Random Forest Classifier on a Loans Dataset
- <b> Objective: </b>Given a dataset of Loan Data from the website [Lending Club](https://www.lendingclub.com), train a Random Forest Classifier model to predict the likelyhood of a borrower fully paying back a loan.

## Project 7 - SVM Classifier on an Iris Flower Dataset
- <b> Objective: </b>Given the famous [Iris Flower Dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set), train a Support Vector Machine Classifier model to correctly predict the species of a flower based on its features.
